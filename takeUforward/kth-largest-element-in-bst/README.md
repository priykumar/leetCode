Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer k.

Return the kth smallest and largest value (1-indexed) of all values of the nodes in the tree.


Return the 1st integer as kth smallest and 2nd integer as kth largest in the returned array.


Examples:
Input : root = [3,1,4,null,2] , k = 1

Output : [1, 4]

Explanation : The 1st smallest value in given BST is 1.

The 1st largest value in given BST is 4.

Input : root = [5, 3, 6, 2, null, null, null, 1] , k = 3

Output : [3, 3]

Explanation : The 3rd smallest value in given BST is 3.

The 3rd largest value in given BST is 3.
