Implement a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue using an array. The implemented queue should support the following operations: push, dequeue, pop, and isEmpty.


Implement the ArrayQueue class:


void push(int x): Adds element x to the end of the queue.

int pop(): Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

int peek(): Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.

boolean isEmpty(): Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
