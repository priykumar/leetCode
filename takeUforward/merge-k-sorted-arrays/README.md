Merge K Sorted Arrays

You are given k sorted arrays, each of size k. Merge all the arrays into one sorted array and return it.

You should use an efficient algorithm with O(kÂ² log k) time complexity.


Examples:
Input: k = 3, arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Input: k = 4, arr = [[1,2,3,4],[2,2,3,4],[5,5,6,6],[7,8,9,9]]

Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9]
