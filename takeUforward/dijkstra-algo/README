Given a weighted, undirected graph of V vertices, numbered from 0 to V-1, and an adjacency list adj where adj[i] is a list of lists containing two integers where the first integer of each list j denotes there is edge between i and j , second integers corresponds to the weight of that edge . 



Given a source node S. Find the shortest distance of all the vertex from the source vertex S. Return a list of integers denoting shortest distance between each node and source vertex S. If a vertex is not reachable from source then its distance will be 109.
