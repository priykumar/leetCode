Given an integer M and an undirected graph with N vertices and E edges. The goal is to determine whether the graph can be coloured with a maximum of M colors so that no two of its adjacent vertices have the same colour applied to them.

In this context, colouring a graph refers to giving each vertex a different colour. If the colouring of vertices is possible then return true, otherwise return false.
