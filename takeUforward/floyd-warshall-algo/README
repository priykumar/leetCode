Given a graph of V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1. Find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix of size n x n. Matrix[i][j] denotes the weight of the edge from i to j. If matrix[i][j]=-1, it means there is no edge from i to j.

Examples:
Input: matrix = [[0, 2, -1, -1],[1, 0, 3, -1],[-1, -1, 0, 1],[3, 5, 4, 0]]

Output: [[0, 2, 5, 6], [1, 0, 3, 4], [4, 6, 0, 1], [3, 5, 4, 0]] 

Explanation: matrix[0][0] is storing the distance from vertex 0 to vertex 0, the distance from vertex 0 to vertex 1 is 2 and so on.
