A celebrity is a person who is known by everyone else at the party but does not know anyone in return. 
Given a square matrix M of size N x N where M[i][j] is 1 if person i knows person j, and 0 otherwise, 
determine if there is a celebrity at the party. Return the index of the celebrity or -1 if no such person exists.

Note that M[i][i] is always 0.
