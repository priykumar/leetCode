Given an undirected connected graph with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1, the task is to implement both 
Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) traversals starting from the 0th vertex. 
The graph is represented using an adjacency list where adj[i] contains a list of vertices connected to 
vertex i. Visit nodes in the order they appear in the adjacency list.
