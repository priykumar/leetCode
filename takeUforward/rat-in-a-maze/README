Given a grid of dimensions n x n. A rat is placed at coordinates (0, 0) and wants to reach at coordinates (n-1, n-1).

Find all possible paths that rat can take to travel from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1). The directions in which rat can move are 'U' (up) , 'D' (down) , 'L' (left) , 'R' (right).

The value 0 in grid denotes that the cell is blocked and rat cannot use that cell for travelling, whereas value 1 represents that rat can travel through the cell. If the cell (0, 0) has 0 value, then mouse cannot move to any other cell.

Note :

In a path no cell can be visited more than once.
If there is no possible path then return empty vector.
