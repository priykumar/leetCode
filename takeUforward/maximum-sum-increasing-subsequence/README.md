Given an array arr[] of positive integers, find the maximum possible sum of a subsequence such that the elements of the subsequence are in strictly increasing order.

The subsequence does not need to be contiguous.
You must choose elements such that their order in the array is preserved and each chosen element is strictly greater than the previous one.

Examples:
Input: arr = [1, 101, 2, 3, 100]

Output: 106

Explanation: The subsequence [1, 2, 3, 100] is strictly increasing and has the maximum sum = 106.

Input: arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The maximum sum increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 3], sum = 6.
